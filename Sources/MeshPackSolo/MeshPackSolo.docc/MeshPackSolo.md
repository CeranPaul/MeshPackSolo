# ``MeshPackSolo``

Build and collect triangles while not using concurrency.


## Overview

Triangles are the simplest and fastest way to represent a boundary that makes up a 3D shape. Code contained in this package can build, check, and store thousands of facets. Triangles can be output as an STL file. Texture coordinates are NOT set or stored.

A future version of this package will treat Mesh as an 'Actor' to take advantage of concurrency.

This code depends on package 'CurvePack' for simple geometry objects.
