# MeshPackSolo

Atomic functions for Mesh that don't use concurrency in class Mesh.

MeshFill is a slightly higher level of utilities. These would never be set up in an Actor.

MeshGen contains functions of a more practical nature. 

The code isn't included here yet, but Meshes can be written to STL files.
